# Adafruit-GFX-font-editor

Editor for bitmap fonts from Adrafruit-GFX Library and TFT_eSPI for Arduino

With this program you can see bitmaps of letters and include or edit one.

For the GLCD font, you can use it to see and create a new one, but you can place the line of bitmaps into the file manually.

You can see some letters added to .h font files in my project [TTGOWeatherStation](https://github.com/JuniorPolegato/TTGOWeatherStation)
